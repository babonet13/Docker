Many people who are owning / hodling Bitcoin want to be a 1st Class Bitcoin Citizen by following the « 3S » rules !
1. Safety : Hold your private key (coz not your keys => not your funds)
2. Scalability : Go Lightning Network (coz no "weight" => no delay, no fee)
3. Sovereignty : Run your own nodes (coz not your hardware => not your node)
