Many people who are owning / "hodling" Bitcoin(s) want to be a 1st Class Bitcoin Citizen by following the « 3S » rules !  
1. __Safety__ : Hold your private key (coz not your _keys_ => not your _funds_). 
2. __Scalability__ : Go Lightning Network (coz no _"weight"_ => no _delay_, no _fee_). 
3. __Sovereignty__ : Run your own nodes (coz not your _machine_ => not your _node_). 
But running theirs own nodes is quite a complex task !
=> That's why the aims of the <A href="https://github.com/babonet13/HostYourNode">HostYourNode</A> projet is to reduce the compexity of this task ...

According <A href="https://www.amazon.fr/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861">Bitcoin Standard<A/> by <A href="https://twitter.com/saifedean">@saifedean<A/>, "Rise in Cost of Nodes and Drop in Their Numberb" (Cf p. 247). is a "How To Kill Bitcoin Risk" (Cf p. 241). 
If convinced people could run theirs owns nodes because of the reducing complexity to build one is a good thing for Bitcoin.
